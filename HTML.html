<h1>What is HTML?</h1> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/120px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" style="float:right;width:200px;height:200px;">

        <p  style="font-size:130%;">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br> With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < img &gt; and < input/&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as < p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br> Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.<br> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

<h1>Disadvantages of HTML language</h1>
<ul style="font-size: 130%;">
<li>It cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it’s a static language.</li>
<li>Making of structure of HTML documents becomes tough to understood.</li>
<li>Errors can be costly.</li>
<li>It is the time consuming as the time it consume to maintain on the colour scheme of a page and to make lists, tables and forms.<li>
<li>It can create only static and plain pages so if we’d like dynamic pages then HTML isn’t useful.</li>
<li>Required to write a lot of code for just creating simple webpage.<li>
<li>We have to check up the deprecated tags, and confirm not ot use them to appear because another language that works with HTML has replaced the first work of the tag; and hence the opposite language need to be understood and learned.</li>
<li>Security features offered by HTML are limited.</li>
<li>If we need to write down long code for creating a webpage then it produces some complexity.
